Test Changes:
- My face was about 3 feet away from the camera
- Head was pressed against back of my chair for head stability
- Each image was done with a brand new calibration

Stability Test:
- Static:
-- Much easier to setup in the center
-- Amount at which crosshair jumps around is not as much

- Dynamic:
-- Less accurate, needed to move head to center the dot
-- Much more shaky compared to static. (amount at which crosshair jumps is much farther).

Target Practice Test:
- Static:
-- Quite reliable, accuracy felt pretty stable and was easier to hold crosshair around the center dot
-- Corner boxes were probably the most difficult to hit
-- Some issue depending on initial head position, where crosshair is more likely to hover slightly above, right or left of dots for a single calibration

- Dynamic:
-- A lot more inconsistent, crosshair was much more sporadic. Distance at which crosshair jumps would jump around box.
-- Edges of the screen were a lot more difficult to hit
-- Inconsistent

Error Sequence Test:
- Static:
-- Depending on calibration, some issues leave where crosshair remains slightly on the left or right of each box for the entire sequence 
   (could be due to accidental head movement)
-- Not as sporadic as dynamic calibration
-- Inconsistent

- Dynamic
-- Crosshair is much more sporadic
-- Inconsistent
-- Left and/or right edges are much worse than static.

- Both:
-- Top two dots always have a big error

Overall Notes:
- Dynamic crosshair causes a lot of unnecessary head movement when moving around the mouse with your arm compared to static
- Clicking on different tests causes too much head movement which can cause just enough to slightly throw us off for each test
- It would be better to test one calibration for all 3 tests instead of a new calibration per test (We are unable to do this successfully due to head moving too much)
- Static calibration is much better and more consistent overall
- We could probably reduce calibration to a 5 point rather than 7 point
- We need crosshair to be more stable
- Crosshair was much more accurate with my head pressed against the back of the chair to keep head from moving as much
