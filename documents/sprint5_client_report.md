## Minutes (8/25/24)
Talked about our goals for the semester
Jon recommended we create a schedule
Discussed improvements to the static calibration and error testing
Discussed implementing a crosshair that takes the average of the past few positions to enhance stability

## Retrospective Summary (8/25/24)
Here's what went well:
  * We learned what to do next

Here's what we'd like to improve:
