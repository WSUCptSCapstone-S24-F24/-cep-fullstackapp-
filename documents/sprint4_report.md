# Sprint 4 Report (4/5/24 - 5/4/24)

## What's New (User Facing)

 * Adjust Randomized Box Locations
 * Swap Direction of Vectors
 * Create Stability Stimuli Test
 * Determine angle of error
 * Convert screen width from pixel to dpi
 * Change target practice to stability test error bounds
 * Split calibration script into multiple scripts
 * Remove Pages
 * Make error sequence into a button
 * Hide webcam on tests
 * Fix the error sequence size

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

Basically, we focused on fixing issues and improving the functions implemented before. For the fixing part, we fixed issues that the vector shows different directions in the error sequence, showing the randomized boxes out of the display, and the error sequences were showed out of display. For the improvement parts, the application shows the actual distance (inch) when the user uses the error sequence tests and the stability test. Also, the error sequence and stability test only show up when the user select the buttons. In addition, we did refactoring the code so the code readability is increased.

## Unfinished Work
Almost all of the work we did finish that we planned. However, some improving tasks such as adding gaming effect for boxes, changing target boxes to be more stimulating, and measuring the distance from the display.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * Our progress feels much better than last sprint. We were able to get more issues completed.
  * Towards the end of the sprint, Dedicated Friday to Sunday with researching new topics and ideas. Monday to Wednesday with implementation.
  * Better communication with Jon via emails. Not just during the meetings.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * Communication and more brainstorming as a team.
   * Find our issues sooner rather than later during implemenation.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * We will dedicate the time on the weekend to research and implementation during the week since we only just started this system.
   * Start our portions sooner, so if we don't understand something, we can ask eachother sooner rather than right before the deadline.
