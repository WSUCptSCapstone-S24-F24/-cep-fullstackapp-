# Sprint 7 Report (10/14/24 - 11/13/24)

## What's New (User Facing)

 * Implemented orientation line for head-tracking
 * Implemented a function that reducing the motion of the crosshair when blinking
 * Changed emoji images to emoji font in memory game
 * Implemented Focal Length
 * Partially implemented head-tracking compensation

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

In this sprint, we focused on adding more useful functions for eye-tacking and fixing issues on function.
We implemented orientation line for head-tracking. From this, the user can easily find where face is looking at by the visual.
Also, we implemented blinking detection, and it reduce the motion when the user blinked and increase the accuracy of eye-tracking.
We also made progress on head-tracking compensation, partially implementing a system that adjusts the pointer's position based on head movements.
Finally, we fixed some issues in memory game. Now memory game has letter emoji as the picture to increase flexibility and speed.

## Unfinished Work
We couldn't complete to implement head-tracking compensation.
